This project goes through extensive **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on a dataset of vehicles. 

**EDA** is important for understanding which algorithm to be used on our dataset and which model would suit better. 

Steps involved in EDA are:

1: Understanding variables

2: Cleaning Dataset 

3: Establishing relationship between variables which is done through data visualization techniques
