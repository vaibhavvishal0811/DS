In this project, handwritten characters ( English characters A-Z) recognition is achieved through neural networks. 

This is accomplished by modeling Convolutional Neural Network that is trained over a dataset containing images of alphabets 

Finally, one can see the character prediction through a sample of output as shown in project directory (Character prediction.png)
