Data Science
The Master branch contains all project files includng the data files. The description of project file will indiicate which data file corresponds to whoc projet file. 
For Ex: Linear Regression project file's description says "Salary_data.csv" is the data file for that project, so one can find the "Salary_data.csv" file in the master branch itself to view the data file for project "Linear Regression". Basically every project file will have one data file and one jupyter notebook file "ipynb". Code for the project is in ipynb file and its data being pulled from corresponding data file.
