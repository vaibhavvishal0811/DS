The DS repository contains all project folders along with their dataset files in it.

All the projects were done while learning and experiencing data science and analysis through last 4 years and some of them are currently in progress. Main credit for my data science journey goes to my 4 years of experience doing data wrangling, anlytics and data visualization achieved though Stanford Healthcare, IBM India and my Masters degree in California State University.

Online learning through Udemy, Coursera, Udacity and books like "Python with data science handbook", "Python Machine Learning" have always acted as my guide through my Data Science journey so far. 

This a new github account to securely store few of my projects. More are being added regularly and will be updated soon.
