The Master branch of DS repository contains all project folders along with their data files in it.

All my Data Science projects were done while learning and experiencing data science since last 4 years and some of them are currently in progress. Main credit for my data science journey goes to my 2 years of experience as Associate System Engineer in IBM Pvt Ltd and my Masters degree in California State University.Online courses like from Udemy, Coursera, Udacity and books like "Python with data science handbook", "Python Machine Learning" etc hace always acted as my guide through my Data Science journey so far. 

This a new github account to securely store few of my work completed in the last 4 years.
